Types of Pod
There are two types of Pods −

1. Single container pod
2. Multi container pod

Single Container Pod
They can be simply created with the kubctl run command, where you have a defined image on the Docker registry which we will pull while creating a pod.

$ kubectl run <name of pod> --image=<name of the image from registry>
Example − We will create a pod with a tomcat image which is available on the Docker hub.

$ kubectl run tomcat --image = tomcat:8.0
This can also be done by creating the yaml file and then running the kubectl create command.

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
   name: Tomcat
spec:
   containers:
   - name: Tomcat
    image: tomcat: 8.0
    ports:
containerPort: 7500
   imagePullPolicy: Always
Once the above yaml file is created, we will save the file with the name of tomcat.yml and run the create command to run the document.

$ kubectl create –f tomcat.yml
It will create a pod with the name of tomcat. We can use the describe command along with kubectl to describe the pod.

Multi Container Pod
Multi container pods are created using yaml mail with the definition of the containers.

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
   name: Tomcat
spec:
   containers:
   - name: Tomcat
    image: tomcat: 8.0
    ports:
containerPort: 7500
   imagePullPolicy: Always
   -name: Database
   Image: mongoDB
   Ports:
containerPort: 7501
   imagePullPolicy: Always
In the above code, we have created one pod with two containers inside it, one for tomcat and the other for MongoDB.
